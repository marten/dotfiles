This is an Emacs configuration collected by someone who really likes the idea behind
Emacs, but digs the modal editing of Vim much more for plain day-to-day stuff. It
uses Evil to alleviate that pain.

I am ignoring package.el in favor of el-get, because the latter is able to actually
access anything and everything, and I think that simple git repositories are the way
to go over ELPA, MELPA and Marmalade.
